The Biorobotics Institute of Sant’Anna, in collaboration with a team of students from Sant’Anna university is taking part in the first challenge.  A participation to other challenges is still under con- sideration and is strongly dependent on the progresses made on the first one and on the availability of hardware for the other challenges, specifically, the terrestrial vehicle with a robotic arm.

## Rules and specification

The  organizers are  constantly  updating rules  and  requirements.  According  to  the latest release, Challenge 1 arena will contain a set of target moving objects.  The targets will consist of:

• A UAV with a detachable target, following a 3D trajectory.  The approximate shape of the trajectory will be specified (e.g.  a figure of 8 shape, for the projection on the ground plane), but  its  location  and  orientation  will  be  randomized.   The  speed  of  the  UAV  will  be  held approximately constant, and will not exceed 10 m/sec.

• The UAV will have a soft target attached to it by a semi-rigid tube and flexible joints.  The target will be of spherical shape of radius less than 0.15m, and a weight less than 0.15kg. The target will disengage from the UAV when a pre-specified force (less than 4N) is applied to it. The specifications of the soft target (including material and color), the semi-rigid tube and the UAV will be provided in due time.

• Tethered Balloons and randomly placed inside the arena:  The balloons will be attached to
ropes of varying lengths.  They will be randomly distributed inside the arena, and will move
with the wind.  The colors, radii and other specifications of the balloons will be provided in
due time.
