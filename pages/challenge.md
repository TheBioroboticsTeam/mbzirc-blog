MBZIRC 2020 will be based on autonomous aerial and ground robots, carrying out navigation and manipulation tasks, in unstructured, outdoor and indoor environments.  MBZIRC 2020 will consist of three challenges and a triathlon type Grand Challenge

## Challenge 1
In Challenge 1 a team of UAVs will autonomously track and interact with a set of objects (for example intruder UAVs) following 3D trajectories inside the arena.  Challenge 1 is motivated by UAV safety, where the team UAVs will attempt to capture and neutralize intruder UAVs inside the arena.


## Challenge 2
In Challenge 2 a team of UAVs and a UGV will collaborate to autonomously locate,  pick, transport  and  assemble  different  types  of  brick  shaped  objects  to  build  pre-defined  structures, in an outdoor environment.  Challenge 2 is motivated by construction automation and autonomous robot based 3D printing of large structures.


## Challenge 3

In Challenge 3 a team of UAVs and a UGV will collaborate to autonomously extinguish a series
of simulated fires in an urban high rise building firefighting scenario.  Challenge 3 is motivated by the use of robots for urban firefighting, and requires the team of robots to collaborate to autonomously carry out a series of urban firefighting related tasks in an outdoor-indoor environment.

## Grand Challenge

The Grand Challenge requires a team of robots (UAVs and UGVs) to compete in a triathlon type event that combines Challenges 1, 2 and 3.
