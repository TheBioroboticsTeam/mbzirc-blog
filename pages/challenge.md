The Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) is an international robotics competition, held every two years in Abu Dhabi, with total prize and team sponsorship of USD 5 Million. MBZIRC aims to provide an ambitious, science-based, and technologically demanding set of challenges in Robotics, open to a large number of international teams.  It is intended to demonstrate the current state of the art in robotics in terms of scientific and technological accomplishments, and to inspire the future of robotics.  

MBZIRC 2020 will be based on autonomous aerial and ground robots, carrying out navigation and manipulation tasks, in unstructured, outdoor and indoor environments.  MBZIRC 2020 will consist of three challenges and a triathlon type Grand Challenge.

## Challenge 1
In Challenge 1 a team of UAVs will autonomously track and interact with a set of objects (for example intruder UAVs) following 3D trajectories inside the arena.  Challenge 1 is motivated by UAV safety, where the team UAVs will attempt to capture and neutralize intruder UAVs inside the arena.

## Challenge 2
In Challenge 2 a team of UAVs and a UGV will collaborate to autonomously locate,  pick, transport  and  assemble  different  types  of  brick  shaped  objects  to  build  pre-defined  structures, in an outdoor environment.  Challenge 2 is motivated by construction automation and autonomous robot based 3D printing of large structures.

## Challenge 3

In Challenge 3 a team of UAVs and a UGV will collaborate to autonomously extinguish a series
of simulated fires in an urban high rise building firefighting scenario.  Challenge 3 is motivated by the use of robots for urban firefighting, and requires the team of robots to collaborate to autonomously carry out a series of urban firefighting related tasks in an outdoor-indoor environment.


## Grand Challenge

The Grand Challenge requires a team of robots (UAVs and UGVs) to compete in a triathlon type event that combines Challenges 1, 2 and 3.


## State of the art review

This is the second edition of the challenge.  The first edition was held in 2017 in Abu Dhabi.  The
challenges consisted in three highly simplified version of the 2020 challenge, specifically:

• The first challenge consisted in a drone which has to autonomously land on a terrestrial veichle with a platform moving in a 8 shaped trajectory on the ground.

• The  second  challenge  consisted  in  a  cooperative  task  between  two  drones  and  a  terrestrial vehicle, which had to perform some object detection and complex interaction with the environment.

• The third challenge consisted in the planning of a strategy to perform a cooperative task in a decentralized way.  Three drones had to cooperate to move objects to some specific area.

• The grand challenge consists in the first three challenges performed together.


The first challenge presents several similarities with the 2020 Challenge:  first of all it requires the autonomous control of a drone which has to perform a pursuit and evasion task, secondly it involves  the  use  of  a  computer  vision  algorithms  which  provides  info  to  a  control  algorithm  to perform the navigation.  It is indeed extremely important to review what has been done in these challenges, specifically:

• Review of the hardware-software platforms

• Review of the winning strategies and algorithms

• Best practices and problems identification
