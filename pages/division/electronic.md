The Electronic Division is responsible for the design of the interface between the sensors and the
high level controller.

## Sonar Sensors interface

At  the  moment  we  are  developing  a  board  to  interface  ten  sonar  sensors  (I2CXL-MaxSonar
RÂ©-EZTM) with the main computer through a micro controller (PIC18F25K50) that allows USB and
I2C connection.
