AI and Deep Learning are playing a pivotal role in many recent Robotics applications This convinced
us that it would be necessary to have a proper section for implementing such solutions for the challenge. We will now discuss how and where to implement such solutions.

## AI in computer vision

Classical techniques in computer vision have proved many times to be very effective to tackle problems such as shape and color recognition. As complexity increases however, there is a strong
tendency to use Deep Learning solution as they are able to automatically extract features of hier-
archical complexity and achieve super human performances in many tasks.

### • The Dataset

### • The DL algorithm

## AI in Control

There are many alternatives to traditional control techniques for this task.
